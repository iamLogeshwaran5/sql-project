/*197. Rising Temperature

Table: Weather

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| recordDate    | date    |
| temperature   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the temperature in a certain day.
Write an SQL query to find all datesâ€™ id with higher temperature compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example:

Weather
+----+------------+-------------+
| id | recordDate | Temperature |
+----+------------+-------------+
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
+----+------------+-------------+
Result table:
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 2  |
| 4  |
+----+
In 2015-01-02, temperature was higher than the previous day (10 -> 25).
In 2015-01-04, temperature was higher than the previous day (20 -> 30).
Note: Datediff() : The first parameter is the date to be substracted from, and the second parameter is the date to be substracted. e.g. datediff(date1, date2) is date1 minus date2.

-- Solution >>


select w1.id
from Weather w1, Weather w2
where w1.Temperature > w2.Temperature
and datediff(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate) = 1;
